# Firebase-Deploy

If you don't have an account on Firebase, go to this site to create an account on [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) or log in ;
After you've successfully logged in, you'll need to create a project on Firebase.

## Step 1: Firebase Console Dashboard:
   1.1) Go to your Firebase console dashboard, where you should see the text **"Go to console"** at the top right-hand side of your page after logging in.

   1.2) The page that opens up will have a `Create a project` button. Click on that button and it will take you to the page where you'll input your project details. (Step 2)

   1.3) If you've previously used Firebase, that means you already have projects on Firebase. In that case, it will bring up a page displaying a list of your projects and a box to `add a new project`.

## Step 2: Create a New Project
   2.1) Click the **`Add project`** card.
   
   2.2) Tick the `Accept Firebase terms` checkbox and the second checkbox.
   
   2.3) Click the `continue` button.
